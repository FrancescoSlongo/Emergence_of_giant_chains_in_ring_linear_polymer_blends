# Emergence of giant chains in ring-linear polymer blends
This is a repository for the article 'Emergence of giant chains in ring-linear polymer blends via efficient self-assembly Monte Carlo'.
The repository is organised as follows:
The folders Figure_1, Figure_2, Figure_3, Figure_4, Figure_5 and Figure_6 contain the data plotted in the corresponding figures in the manuscript, as well as some Jupyter notebooks used to generate all the images. The 'Figures_SI' folder contains the subfolders 'Figure_SI_1', 'Figure_SI_2', 'Figure_SI_3', 'Figure_SI_4', 'Figure_SI_5', 'Figure_SI_6', 'Figure_SI_7' and 'Figure_SI_8', which contain the data and code for the plots in the Supplementary Information.

The code has been commented using generative AI.
